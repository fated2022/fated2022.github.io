The annual conference of the Educational Data Mining society is intended to foster community and exchange of ideas among those working in the field of educational data mining, and the FATED 2022 workshop is intended to contribute to that fostering of community. The code of conduct below will govern our workshop, and is drawn from the [EDM 2020 conference code of conduct](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2020/code-of-conduct/).

Everyone involved in the workshop — from organizers to presenters to attendees — is expected to adhere to the code of conduct throughout the workshop, both in their formal and informal participation and in all channels of interaction and communication, including social media. We also expect that communication and contacts that begin at the workshop and continue afterwards will adhere to the code of conduct.

Everyone has a right to participate in the conference free from harassment and intimidation, and in an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of all people and their potential to contribute valuable ideas to the scientific discussion. Everyone has the right to a safe and discrimination-free conference regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability status, religion or lack of religion, physical appearance, technology choices, or other identities or beliefs. What may be intended as "joking" can be offensive and demeaning. Bullying, intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and behavior that interferes with another participant's full participation will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to sexual harassment, unwelcome repeated contacts, harassing photography or recording, unwelcome sexual attention, display of belittling or gratuitous images in public spaces (including in contexts like a virtual Zoom background), public vulgar exchanges, and diminutive characterizations, which are all unwelcome in this community. Revealing private information in a public setting without permission, such as posting a participant's personal information, is not permitted.

If you see someone engaging in any of these behaviors, please ask them to stop. If you experience or observe any behavior you're concerned about or that you believe may constitute harassment or discrimination, please report it to Anna Rafferty (arafferty@carleton.edu), one of the workshop organizers, via email. During the conference, we will follow up within 24 hours, and outside of the days of the conference, we will respond within two business days. 

Consequences for violating this code of conduct will be decided by workshop organizers and may include a formal or informal warning, expulsion from the workshop with no refund, reporting the incident to the EDM organization with a recommendation of barring the individual from participation in future conferences or the EDM organization, reporting the incident to the offender's local institution or funding agencies, or other actions. A response of "just joking" will not be accepted; behavior can be harassing without an intent to offend. If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available.
